You will need to chart on a different engine because the chart editor cannot be changed with lua,
any existing extra key charts should work.

Place the "Set Key Count" event anywhere in the song, type the key count you want and load the song.

You can change your controls inside the script if you scroll down and find the "maniaData" array
(might update this later with a rebind menu since it technically saves)

Mania changes are also included but work slightly differently (for charting) and
don't require you to set the highest key count first, so it doesn't matter what the starting key count is.

also you can add more keys if you want just by adding more to the "maniaData" array
dont really recommend since key amounts that high arent really fun to play but you can just use for joke stuff ig

Currently does not support pixel notes (may add in future)


Adding Noteskins/notetypes:
you can just add these normally unlike the original lua extra keys

the xml format is slightly different but similar to regular psych
you can edit existing xmls quickly by using find and replace in something like visual studio code (Ctrl+F)
